# PresideCMS Extension: Admin Dashboards

This is an extension for PresideCMS that provides APIs and a methodolgy for creating user customizable dashboard interfaces in Preside admin.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/pixl8/preside-ext-admin-dashboards/wiki) for documentation.

## Installation

Install with:

```box install preside-ext-admin-dashboards```

## User stories

The following user stories describe the functionality of this extension:

* As an admin user, I want to be able to view a dashboard with multiple widgets so that I can get an overview of a particular data scenario(s)
* As an admin administrator, I want to be able to limit access to particular dashboard widgets so that I can protect sensitive data and functionality
* As an admin user, I want to be able to configure widgets and have my configuration persisted so that I can customize my view of a dashboard

## What's next

We've created this extension with what we feel is the bare minimum functionality for a first release. Obvious features that are lacking:

* Ability for a dashboard to have _optional_ widgets that users can add to a dashboard if they want
* Ability for a dashboard user to drag items around and configure them the way they like
* Ability for a dashboard user to save a dashboard configuration and share it with other users
